# RecoilForCounterInReact
<h1>Simple Counter App using Recoil and Material-UI </h1>
Description:
The "Simple Counter App" is a small-scale web application built using React, Recoil for state management, and Material-UI for UI components. This app provides a user-friendly interface to increment and decrement a numerical counter value using buttons. It demonstrates how to utilize Recoil's state management capabilities to maintain a shared state across components.

Features:

Increment and Decrement Buttons: The app features two buttons, "Increase" and "Decrease," which allow users to adjust the counter value.
Real-time Counter Display: A counter value is displayed prominently in the center of the card. As the user clicks the buttons, the counter updates in real-time to reflect the changes.
Material-UI Styling: The app employs Material-UI's Card and Button components for a clean and responsive user interface.
Recoil State Management: The app utilizes Recoil, a state management library, to maintain the counter value as a shared state. It showcases the use of atoms for defining and managing global state.
How It Works:

The app's main component, App, is wrapped in a RecoilRoot to enable the use of Recoil's state management features.
Within the App component, a Material-UI Card holds the UI components: a Typography header, the Buttons component, and the CountComp component.
The Buttons component renders the Increase and Decrease components side by side, each containing a Material-UI Button.
Both the Increase and Decrease components utilize the useSetRecoilState hook to update the counter value stored in the Recoil atom (CountState) when their respective buttons are clicked.
The CountComp component retrieves the current value of the counter from the Recoil atom using the useRecoilValue hook and displays it using an h1 element.
Usage:
Users can open the app in a web browser and interact with the "Increase" and "Decrease" buttons. Clicking these buttons will modify the counter value displayed on the screen.

This project serves as a basic example of how to implement state management with Recoil and create a simple interactive interface using Material-UI components. It's suitable for learning and demonstrating core concepts related to state management, component composition, and UI design in React applications.
